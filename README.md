## My process

### Built with



- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScript
- Class Variance Authority (CVA)
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) - For switch button



### What I learned
- I create just one Component for Plan card and use CVA to crate variant. 
- I pass down the data using context and control the overall state using Context Provider pattern.


### Continued development
- I will start learning more robust UI component library and it's tooling


### Useful resources

- [Class-Variance-Authority](https://cva.style/docs) - This helped me to crate variant for my Plan Card
